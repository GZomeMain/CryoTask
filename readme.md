## 🚀 Overview

**CryoTask** is a lightweight Windows utility designed to give you precise control over your system resources. Whether you have a game running in the background, a heavy IDE, or a RAM-hungry browser, CryoTask helps you reclaim performance without closing your apps.

The modern "Card View" interface provides a real-time system overview, displaying current CPU usage, total processes, and a detailed RAM usage bar. It combines the functionality of a **Process Freezer** (pausing execution) and a **Memory Cleaner** (like Mem Reduct) into one application.

## ✨ Features

* **❄️ Suspend (Freeze) Apps:** Completely pause an application's processes. This drops its CPU usage to **0%**, stopping battery drain and heat generation while keeping the app open.
* **🧹 Smart RAM Trimming:** Uses native Windows APIs to force applications to release unused memory (Working Set) back to the OS.
* **🕐 Scheduling:** Set up **Periodic Trim** to automatically clean an application's memory every few minutes, ensuring low RAM usage without manual intervention.
* **🧠 Group Awareness:** Automatically detects multi-process applications (like **Google Chrome, Discord, VS Code**) and manages the entire group at once.
* **⭐ Pinning:** Pin your most frequently used processes to the top of the list for instant access.
* **🛡️ Safe Mode & Advanced Control:** Defaults to **Safe Mode**, which filters out critical system services. Switch to **Advanced Mode** to view and manage all active processes.
* **💾 State Persistence:** Remembers suspended apps, pinned favorites, and scheduled actions even after you close and reopen CryoTask.
* **🎨 Modern UI:** Built with `CustomTkinter` for a clean, Windows 11-style dark mode interface featuring interactive status dots and high-DPI scaling.

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Executable (Recommended for Users)
No coding knowledge required.
1.  Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/GZomeMain/CryoTask/releases).
2.  Download the latest `CryoTask.zip`.
3.  Extract and run `CryoTask.exe` as **Administrator**.

### Option 2: Run from Source (For Developers)
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GZomeMain/CryoTask.git](https://github.com/GZomeMain/CryoTask.git)
    cd CryoTask
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    * *Note: You must run your terminal/CMD as Administrator for memory trimming to work.*
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## ⚙️ How it Works

CryoTask interacts directly with the Windows API to perform its functions:

1.  **Suspending:** It utilizes `win32api` and `SuspendThread`. It iterates through every thread of the target process and pauses execution. The OS stops scheduling CPU time for these threads until resumed.
2.  **Trimming:** It calls `psapi.dll` -> `EmptyWorkingSet`. This instructs Windows to move the data currently in the application's RAM (Working Set) to the Pagefile (Disk), freeing up physical RAM for other tasks. The app will reload this data from disk only when needed.

## 🛠️ Build it Yourself

If you want to compile the `.exe` yourself:

1.  Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
2.  Run the included build script:
    ```bash
    python build.py
    ```
3.  The executable will appear in the `dist` folder.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

While CryoTask's Safe Mode and filters help prevent accidental issues, suspending or trimming the memory of unstable applications or active anti-cheat software may still cause crashes. **Use responsibly.**
